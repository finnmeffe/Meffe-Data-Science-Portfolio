The purpose of this app is to offer functionality for exploratory data analysis using the Palmer's Penguins dataset. There are three main functions:
The first provides an overview of the data, the second allows for basic filtering on histogram data, and the third allows the user to construct a graph
that can help visualize trends across species by features.
